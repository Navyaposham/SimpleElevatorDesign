## Introduction 

Elevators, a cornerstone of modern urban infrastructure, have transformed the way we navigate multi-story  buildings,  offering  unparalleled  convenience  and  access.  Their  operational precision is vital to ensuring efficient vertical transportation while prioritizing passenger safety. 

Our focus lies in the creation of a System Verilog Finite State Machine (FSM) that governs an elevator control system. This system caters to the intricate demands of multi-story buildings, balancing passenger requests and security measures. 

The elevator control system outlined herein adheres to a comprehensive set of requirements. These include accommodating user floor selections, managing passenger priority requests, providing an emergency stop mechanism, employing limit sensors for floor range supervision, orchestrating a well-structured finite state machine, developing a user-friendly interface, and subjecting the system to rigorous testing and simulation.
